<b>Data Science Project </b><br><hr>
<b>Topic of Dataset:</b> Adani Ports Market Share Data (27/11/2007 - 30/04/2021)<hr>

<b> Project divided into small tasks: </b>

1. Uploading the Dataset:- 
   The initial step involves uploading the dataset containing historical market share data for Adani Ports. This dataset serves as the foundation for all subsequent analysis and modeling. <br><br>
2. Cleaning and preprocessing:- 
   Data cleaning and preprocessing are performed to handle missing values, remove duplicates, and format the data appropriately. This step ensures the dataset is ready for analysis and machine learning modeling. <br><br>
3. Performing Descriptive statistics:- 
   Descriptive statistics are computed to summarize the central tendency, dispersion, and shape of the dataset’s distribution. Key metrics such as mean, median, and standard deviation are analyzed. <br><br>
4. Graph for visual representation:- 
   Various graphs and charts are plotted to visually represent the data. These visualizations help in understanding trends, patterns, and anomalies in the dataset. <br><br>
5. Using an existing Machine Learning model:- 
   An existing machine learning model is applied to the dataset to identify patterns and make predictions. The choice of the model is based on its suitability for time series analysis and forecasting. <br><br>
6. Plotting a graph for the above applied model:- 
   The performance of the machine learning model is illustrated through graphs, showing how well the model fits the historical data. These plots help in evaluating the model’s accuracy and reliability. <br><br>
7. Future Prediction using the ML model:- 
   The trained machine learning model is used to make future predictions about Adani Ports market share. These predictions provide insights into potential future trends and assist in strategic decision-making. <br><hr>
